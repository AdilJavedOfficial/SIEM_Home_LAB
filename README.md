## üîç Overview

The **Wazuh Home Lab** is designed to provide hands-on experience with **Wazuh**, a security platform that offers **Extended Detection and Response (XDR)** and **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** capabilities. This lab setup will help you:

- Monitor and analyze endpoints for security events.
- Detect real-time threats and respond accordingly.
- Leverage adversary emulation tools to simulate attacks and improve detection techniques.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following:

- A virtualized environment (e.g., **VMware** or **VirtualBox**) to host the Wazuh components.
- **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS** installed on your virtual machines.
- **At least 4 GB of RAM** and **2 CPU cores** for the Wazuh manager.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### Part 1: Deploying the Wazuh Manager

1. **Update your system**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https unzip wget libcap2-bin software-properties-common lsb-release gnupg2 -y
   ```

3. **Add Wazuh repository**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH | sudo apt-key add -
   echo "deb https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
   ```

4. **Install Wazuh manager**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install wazuh-manager -y
   ```

5. **Start and enable the Wazuh manager**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now wazuh-manager
   ```

### Part 2: Integrating Wazuh Agents

1. **Install the Wazuh agent on your endpoints**:
   - Download the agent package suited to your operating system from the [Wazuh downloads page](https://wazuh.com/downloads/).
   - Follow the installation steps for your OS.

2. **Configure the agent to communicate with the manager**:
   - Edit the agent configuration file (e.g., `ossec.conf`) to set the manager's IP address.
   - Use the `manage_agents` utility to register the agent with the manager.

3. **Start and enable the Wazuh agent**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now wazuh-agent
   ```

## üíª Adversary Emulation

To improve the capabilities of your Wazuh Home Lab, you can integrate adversary emulation tools like **Atomic Red Team**.

- **Deploying Atomic Red Team**:
  - Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.git
    ```
  - Navigate to the cloned directory and follow the setup instructions.

Using these tools, you can simulate real-world attacks, test detection rules, and enhance the system's overall security posture.
